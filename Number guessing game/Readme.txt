                                                              How does the game works?
This program works on the basis of guessing.
At first user should type a range.
The range is according to the user wish.
User can enter any range.
Compiler generates a random number according to the given range.
But,user will not know the random number generated by the compiler.
Compiler ask the user to make the guess.
If the guess (i.e) the number entered by the user is greater than the random number then it shows "You are above the number".
If the guess (i.e) the number entered by the user is smaller than the random number then it shows "You are below the number".
If the guess (i.e) the number entered by the user matches  the the random number then it shows "You got it".
It also shows the total number of guesses used by the user to find out the actual random number.
